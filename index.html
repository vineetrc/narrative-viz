                    In this scatter plot, we compare the 3-point shooting percentage to the 2-point shooting percentage of top NBA playoff performers. Each circle represents a player, with the size of the circle proportional to their points per game, and the color indicating their position (C, PF, PG, SG).

                    This scatter plot concludes the narrative by highlighting player contributions in terms of effective field goal percentage (eFG%) and points per game during the NBA playoffs. Each circle represents a player, with the size of the circle proportional to their points per game, and the color indicating their position (C, PF, PG, SG, SF).
                    Please use the team and position filters to filter the data and see the efficiency vs point production as compared to the Leage MVP, Nikola Jokic.

                    Key insights:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nikola Jokic</strong>, marked as the League MVP, stands out with a high eFG% and significant points per game, showcasing his efficiency and scoring ability.</li>
                    <li>Centers (C) and Power Forwards (PF) often exhibit higher eFG%, reflecting their proficiency in close-range and efficient scoring.</li>
                    <li>Guards (PG and SG) generally have a wider distribution in eFG%, highlighting their varied roles in driving to the basket and outside shooting.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This visualization allows us to see the efficiency and scoring performance of players from different positions, emphasizing the importance of high eFG% for top scorers. The team and position filters enable users to focus on specific subsets of players, making it easier to analyze performance based on selected criteria.
